### Student Performance prediction

### Project Overview 
The project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts student performance based on various factors. The model uses historical data to identify patterns and relationships between student characteristics, learning behaviors, and academic outcomes. Students can input their information and receive a predicted score, helping them set realistic goals and identify areas for improvement.

### Technical Approach 

 **Data Modeling:**  Collected and preprocessed a dataset containing student information, academic records, and learning behaviors.
 
 **Data Transformation:** Applied feature engineering and data normalization techniques to prepare the data for model training.
 
 **Model Training:** Developed and trained a machine learning model using a suitable algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks) to predict student performance.
 
 **UI Development:** Built a user-friendly web interface using Flask to allow students to input their information and receive predicted scores.

 **Deployment:**
 
 **AWS:** Deployed the application on AWS using EC2 instances and Docker Hub for containerization.
 
 **Azure:** Deployed the application on Azure using Ubuntu-based virtual machines and Docker Hub for containerization.
 
**CI/CD:** Implemented continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment of the application.


 **Technologies Used:**
 
 **Machine learning:** scikit-learn
 
 **Data preprocessing:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
 
 **Web development:** Flask, HTML, CSS
 
 **Deployment:** AWS, Azure, Docker Hub, Ubuntu, EC2, CI/CD
